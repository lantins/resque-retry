## HEAD

## 1.2.1 (TBD)

* Fixed Rubinius (rbx) Kernel.rand "invalid argument - 0.0 (ArgumentError)" error with ExponentialBackoff when `retry_delay_multiplicand_min >= retry_delay_multiplicand_max` by making defaults 1.0 & 1.1 respectively (Sai)

## 1.2.0 (2014-05-19)

* Fixed scenario where job does not get retried correctly when `perform` is not called as expected.
* Feature: Optional `@expire_retry_key_after` settings; expires retry counters from redis to save you cleaning up stale state.
* Feature: Expose inner-workings of plugin through debug messages using `Resque.logger` (when logging level is Logger:DEBUG).

## 1.1.4 (2014-03-17)

* Fixed displaying retry information in resque web interface, caused by `Resque::Helpers` being deprecated.
* Feature: Allow `@fatal_exceptions` as inverse of `@retry_exceptions`, when fatal exception is raised the job will be immediately fail.
* Feature: Allow a random retry delay (within a range) when using exponential backoff strategy.

## 1.1.1 (2014-03-12)

* Adjust gem dependency `resque-scheduler`.

## 1.1.0 (2014-03-12)

* Remove dependence on `Resque::Helpers`, will be removed in Resque 2.0
* Use SHA1 for default `#retry_identifier` to prevents issues with long args gobbling space.
* Minimum version of Resque is now ~> 1.25

## 1.0.0 (2012-09-07)

** !!! WARNING !!! INCLUDES NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGES **

* Fixed issues related to infinate job retries and v1.20.0 of resque.
* Minimum gem dependency versions changed: resque >= 1.10.0, resque-scheduler >= 1.9.9
* Feature: Setting `@retry_job_delegate` allows you to seperate the orignal job from a the retry job. (@tanob/@jniesen)
* Web interface will work without needing to `require` your job code. (n.b. less details avaialble via web).
* IMPORTANT: `#identifier` method has been namedspaced to `#retry_identifier`.
* Bugfix: `Remove` button on retry web interface was not working.
* Feature: Allow `tagging` exceptions with a module instead of an exception class. (@tils - Tilmann Singer)

## 0.2.2 (2011-12-08)

* Feature: Ability to set `retry_delay` per exception type. (Dave Benvenuti)

## 0.2.1 (2011-11-23)

* Bugfix: Fixed error when we tried to parse a number/string as JSON on the reque-retry web interface.

## 0.2.0 (2011-11-22)

**INCLUDES NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGES**

* IMPORTANT: `retry_limit` behaviour has changed. (Nicolas Fouch√©)
    PREVIOUSLY: 0 == infinite retries.
           NOW: -1 == infinite retries; 0 == means never retry.

* Bugfix: `#redis_retry_key` incorrectly built key when custom identifier was used. (Bogdan Gusiev)
* Feature: Ability to sleep worker after re-queuing a job, may be used to bias
           against the same worker from picking up the job again. (Michael Keirnan)
* Feature: Ability to remove retry jobs using resque-web. (Thiago Morello)
* Added example demo application.
* Added Bundler `Gemfile`.

## 0.1.0 (2010-08-29)

* Feature: Multiple failure backend with retry suppression.
* Feature: resque-web tab showing retry information.
* Improved README documentation, added a 'Quick Start' section.

## 0.0.6 (2010-07-12)

* Feature: Added support for custom retry criteria check callbacks.

## 0.0.5 (2010-06-27)

* Handle our own dependancies.

## 0.0.4 (2010-06-16)

* Relax gemspec dependancies.

## 0.0.3 (2010-06-02)

* Bugfix: Make sure that `redis_retry_key` has no whitespace.

## 0.0.2 (2010-05-06)

* Bugfix: Were calling non-existent method to delete redis key.
* Delay no-longer falls back to `sleep`. resque-scheduler is a required dependancy.
* Redis key doesn't include ending colon `:` if no args were passed to the job.

## 0.0.1 (2010-04-27)

* First release.
